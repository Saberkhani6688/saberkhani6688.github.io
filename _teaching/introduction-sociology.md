- Created and taught an engaging and comprehensive undergraduate course in multiple semesters (Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024, Fall 2024) focusing on foundational sociological concepts. Students developed a strong foundation in classical and contemporary sociological theory and research methods. They were trained to critically analyze pressing social issues, including inequality, race, gender, globalization, and institutional power structures, across both U.S. and international contexts. The course emphasized analytical thinking, academic writing, and the application of sociological insight to real-world challenges.
