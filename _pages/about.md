Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Sociology at Boston College. My research bridges collective behavior and social movements, political sociology, organizational studies, computational social science, and quantitative methods, with a regional focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

At the heart of my work is understanding how contentious politics emerge from the strategic interactions of diverse actors, state institutions, oil companies as organizational actors, civil society organizations, and local communities. My dissertation introduces *petroprotest*, protests concerning the production, consumption, or impacts of oil and gas. It develops the *petro field* framework, a contested arena where states, companies, and communities continually renegotiate the stakes, rules, and meanings of oil. Drawing on field theory, my work offers a multilevel perspective examining how corporate governance structures, ownership arrangements (National Oil Companies versus International Oil Companies), and spatial proximity to oil infrastructure shape protest dynamics.

Methodologically, I use computational text analysis, geospatial modeling, survey experiments, regression analysis, and comparative-historical analysis to examine sociopolitical and contentious dynamics. I have designed and implemented original surveys in Iraq, analyzed global protest events across 160 countries, and constructed novel datasets on state-led mobilization in Iran.

My research has been published in *Comparative Political Studies* and *Alzheimer's Disease & Associated Disorders*, with additional papers currently under review at *American Sociological Review*, *American Journal of Sociology*, and *Comparative Political Studies*. My policy analyses have appeared in *Foreign Affairs* and *Middle East Report Online*.
