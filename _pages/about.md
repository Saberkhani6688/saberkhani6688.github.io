Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Sociology at Boston College. My research bridges collective behavior and social movements, political sociology, computational social science, and quantitative methods, with a regional focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

My work examines how contentious politics emerge from the strategic interactions of diverse actorsâ€”state institutions, corporations, and local communities. I particularly focus on disputes over oil governance, the legitimacy of institutional arrangements, and the mechanisms that either provoke protests or promote stability. Grounded in field theory, my research offers a multilevel perspective on how political contention evolves and how institutional arrangements shape protest outcomes.

Methodologically, I use computational text analysis, geospatial modeling, survey experimentation, regression analysis, and comparative-historical analysis to study complex sociopolitical dynamics. I have designed and carried out original surveys in Iraq, analyzed global protest events across 160 countries, and created several datasets on state-led mobilization in Iran.

My work has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_ and _Alzheimer Disease & Associated Disorders_, with other papers currently under review at _American Sociological Review_, _American Journal of Sociology_, _British Journal of Political Science_, and _The Journals of Gerontology, Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences_. My policy analyses have appeared in _Foreign Affairs_ and _Middle East Report Online_.
