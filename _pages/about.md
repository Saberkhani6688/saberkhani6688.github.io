Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Sociology at Boston College. My research bridges collective behavior and social movements, political sociology, computational social science, and quantitative methods, with a regional focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

I study how contentious politics emerge from the strategic interactions of diverse actorsâ€”state institutions, corporations, civil society organizations, and local communities. My research particularly focuses on disputes over oil governance, the legitimacy of institutional arrangements, and the mechanisms that either provoke protest or promote stability. Grounded in field theory, my work offers a multilevel perspective on how political contention evolves and how institutional structures shape protest outcomes.

Methodologically, I use computational text analysis, geospatial modeling, survey experiments, regression analysis, and comparative-historical analysis to examine complex sociopolitical dynamics. I have designed and implemented original surveys in Iraq, analyzed global protest events across 160 countries, and constructed novel datasets on state-led mobilization in Iran.

My research has been published in *Comparative Political Studies* and *Alzheimer Disease & Associated Disorders*, with additional papers currently under review at *American Sociological Review*, *American Journal of Sociology*, *British Journal of Political Science*, and *The Journals of Gerontology: Series B*. My policy analyses have appeared in *Foreign Affairs* and *Middle East Report Online*.
