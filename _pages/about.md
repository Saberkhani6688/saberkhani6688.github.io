I am a sociologist interested in understanding how contentious politics arise from the strategic interactions among diverse actors within cultural and institutional fields. In my research, I explore how state institutions, corporations, civil society organizations, and local communities engage in struggles over the governance of oil resources, the legitimacy of institutional arrangements, and the mechanisms that either stabilize or destabilize these field settlements. This work reveals why certain institutional configurations lead to protests while others maintain stability.

My dissertation introduces the concept of the "petro" field as a Strategic Action Field where state actors, corporations, and civil society engage in contestation over the governance of natural resources. Utilizing an original cross-national dataset of over 8,000 "petroprotests" across more than 160 countries, I demonstrate how institutional configurations—including executive corruption, ownership structures, and civil society engagement—shape the relationship between resource governance and contentious politics. This research combines rigorous quantitative methods with innovative theoretical frameworks to reveal how resource management influences democratic accountability and state-society relations.

My methodological approach combines computational text analysis, geospatial modeling, and survey experiments to examine complex sociopolitical phenomena at multiple levels. For the cross-national component, I systematically identified protest patterns across more than 160 countries using a two-stage computational process that analyzed over 170,000 potential events. I transformed this data into a detailed grid-cell structure with a resolution of 50 × 50 km, allowing me to connect local environmental degradation from oil operations, particularly SO₂ emissions, directly to protest risk in specific localities.
To uncover nuances often overlooked in large-N studies, I conducted an original, nationally stratified survey involving over 700 Iraqi respondents from diverse regions. This survey incorporated sophisticated conjoint experiments that measured how specific governance attributes affect public attitudes toward oil management and political participation. My analysis reveals that individuals in oil-producing districts perceive significantly higher levels of executive corruption and environmental degradation—perceptions that strongly predict protest participation. Importantly, these grievances do not apply uniformly across all extractive contexts; respondents from regions with non-oil resources such as sulfur, zinc, and phosphate demonstrate markedly different attitudes. This distinct politicization of environmental issues in petroleum-producing regions provides compelling evidence for my theory of field-specific dynamics that influence the meanings and avenues of protest.


I have published research in Comparative Political Studies and Alzheimer's Disease & Associated Disorders, and my policy analyses have appeared in Foreign Affairs and Middle East Report Online. My work on pro-government mobilization in Iran has been recognized at leading conferences, including the American Sociological Association (ASA), the American Political Science Association (APSA), and the Social Science History Association (SSHA).
