## Overview
What mechanisms within the oil sector give rise to collective mobilization, and how do governance structures and civil society engagement shape these dynamics? This dissertation introduces the concept of "petro protests" to explore how systemic grievances, executive corruption, and civil society engagement influence protests related to the oil sector.

## Global Distribution of Petro Protests and Oil Infrastructure

### Petro Protests Distribution

### Oil Sector Infrastructure

## Research Design
Drawing on original cross-national data from 2005–2019 and fixed-effects negative binomial and zero-inflated regression models, this study examines how institutional arrangements—particularly executive corruption and ownership structures—mediate the relationship between oil sector presence and collective action.

## Theoretical Framework
The study combines three interconnected theories:

1. **Grievance-based Theory**: Examines how inequitable oil wealth distribution fuels collective discontent in resource-dependent economies. This theory helps explain why resource abundance often leads to social tensions rather than prosperity.

2. **Social Threat Theory**: Explains how perceived threats—such as fuel price hikes, subsidy removals, and job losses—can catalyze protests. These immediate threats often transform latent grievances into active mobilization.

3. **Moral Economy**: Shows how violations of public expectations regarding fair resource distribution can escalate into collective action. This framework helps understand how perceptions of justice and fairness shape protest dynamics.

## Key Findings

- Executive corruption amplifies the protest-inducing effects of oil sector facilities, particularly under National Oil Companies (NOCs), where public expectations of accountability are higher
- International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating under stricter transparency standards exhibit weaker links to protest dynamics
- Civil society engagement moderates these effects: higher consultation reduces protest likelihood, while lower repression intensifies it
- The relationship between oil facilities and protests is non-linear, with institutional quality playing a crucial mediating role
- Ownership structures (NOCs vs. IOCs) significantly influence how corruption affects protest dynamics

## Active Research: Iraq Case Study
Currently conducting survey research in Iraq examining:

- Public perceptions of oil sector governance
- Patterns of protest participation
- Views on resource distribution
- Civil society engagement
- Local experiences with oil sector facilities
- Community-company relations
- Environmental and health impacts
- Economic benefits distribution

### Survey Implementation
- Comprehensive questionnaire covering multiple dimensions of oil sector governance
- Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data
- Focus on both urban and rural areas
- Special attention to regions with high concentration of oil facilities

## Research Contributions
This research advances our understanding of contentious politics in several key ways:

1. Demonstrates how institutional configurations moderate the relationship between resource wealth and collective action
2. Identifies mechanisms through which corruption and ownership structures shape mobilization
3. Provides new empirical foundations for analyzing state-society relations in oil-producing countries
4. Develop first systematic cross-national dataset on petro protests
5. Offers policy-relevant insights for improving oil sector governance
6. Contributes to theories of collective action and resource politics

## Data and Methods

### Quantitative Analysis
- Original cross-national dataset (2005-2019)
- Fixed-effects negative binomial regression
- Zero-inflated regression models
- Spatial analysis of protest patterns
- Network analysis of protest diffusion

### Qualitative Components
- Survey research in Iraq
- Comprehensive analysis of oil sector facilities
- Process tracing of protest events
- Content analysis of protest demands
- Stakeholder interviews

## Policy Implications
This research offers several important insights for policymakers:

1. The importance of transparency in oil sector governance
2. The role of institutional design in preventing conflicts
3. The value of civil society engagement in resource management
4. The need for equitable distribution of resource benefits
5. The significance of community consultation in oil sector operations
