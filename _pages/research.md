## Overview

Why do some oil-rich countries experience persistent, nonviolent mobilization instead of violent conflict or political compliance? My research introduces the concepts of **petroprotest** and the **Petro Field** framework to explain how breakdowns in oil governance—particularly **executive corruption** and **state ownership of oil companies**—transform petroleum from a source of national wealth into a catalyst for collective action.

Rather than treating oil wealth as inherently stabilizing or destabilizing, my work demonstrates that corruption within **National Oil Companies (NOCs)** violates the public’s moral expectation that oil revenues should benefit society. This betrayal fuels contention in highly institutionalized but structurally fragile petrostates.

## Theoretical Contribution: The Petro Field

Building on **Strategic Action Field (SAF)** theory, I conceptualize the oil sector as a **Petro Field**—a meso-level arena where state officials, oil companies, and local communities interact, negotiate legitimacy, and contest the distribution of oil wealth. Within this field:

- **Executive corruption** disrupts the existing equilibrium by eroding shared governance norms.  
- **Ownership structure** shapes how corruption is interpreted: NOCs carry symbolic weight as guardians of public wealth, while IOCs remain relatively insulated.  
- Field disruptions give rise to **petroprotests**, unarmed collective actions rooted in material and symbolic claims about oil.

## Conceptual Innovation: Petroprotest

I define **petroprotest** as *unarmed collective action explicitly linked to the governance, distribution, or symbolic meaning of oil resources*. These protests:

- Emerge from perceived violations of the moral contract around oil as a national good  
- Frequently target **NOCs** as symbols of broken public trust  
- Combine material demands (jobs, infrastructure, environmental protections) with symbolic demands (justice, sovereignty, anti-corruption)

## Multi-Scalar Empirical Design

My research employs a **telescopic, multi-scalar methodology** linking global patterns to local perceptions:

1. **Cross-National Analysis (2005–2019)**  
   - Created the first systematic dataset of **8,200+ petroprotests**  
   - Negative binomial models show oil infrastructure predicts protest **only in high-corruption contexts**, with the strongest effects in NOC-dominated sectors

2. **Subnational Spatial Analysis**  
   - 50×50 km grid-cell models reveal petroprotests **cluster near oil infrastructure**, especially where executive corruption is high  
   - Protests peak at moderate distances from facilities, reflecting a “peripheral mobilization” dynamic

3. **Individual-Level Evidence: Original Iraq Survey**  
   - Online survey across 90 districts (N = 797)  
   - Protest participation is strongly correlated with perceptions that executives divert oil revenues and with distrust in NOCs

## Key Findings

- **Executive corruption** transforms oil from a source of prosperity into a symbol of dispossession.  
- **National Oil Companies (NOCs)** act as focal points for public anger when they are perceived to violate the social contract.  
- **Petroprotests** are highly spatialized, morally charged, and often persistently nonviolent.  
- Governance structures—not just resource endowments—determine whether oil triggers stability or mobilization.

## Active Research: The Iraqi Petro Field

My ongoing fieldwork in Iraq explores:

- Local perceptions of corruption and trust in NOCs vs. IOCs  
- Protest participation patterns in high-extraction zones  
- Community-company relations and infrastructure access  
- Environmental and health consequences of oil operations  

This micro-level evidence complements the global and subnational analyses, bridging structural dynamics with lived experiences.

## Contributions

1. **Theoretical** – Defines the *Petro Field* and *petroprotest*, advancing meso-level theories of resource politics.  
2. **Empirical** – Produces the first cross-national petroprotest dataset and a subnational mapping of oil-related contention.  
3. **Methodological** – Implements a telescopic, multi-level design linking macro patterns to micro-level claim-making.  
4. **Policy-Relevant** – Offers insights for mitigating unrest through transparency, institutional reform, and public accountability.  
5. **Comparative** – Challenges simplistic “oil curse” narratives by showing when and how unarmed mobilization arises in petrostates.
