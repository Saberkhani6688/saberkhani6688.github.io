## Overview

Why do some oil-rich countries experience persistent, nonviolent mobilization instead of violent conflict or compliance? This research introduces the concept of **petroprotest** and the **Petro Field** framework to explain how institutional breakdowns in oil governance—especially executive corruption and state ownership—turn oil into a flashpoint for collective action.

Rather than assuming oil wealth causes either stability or violence, this study shows that **corruption within National Oil Companies (NOCs)** violates the public's moral expectations of collective benefit, fueling contention in highly institutionalized, yet structurally fragile, petrostates.

## Theoretical Framework: The Petro Field

Drawing on **Strategic Action Field (SAF)** theory, the oil sector is conceptualized as a **Petro Field**—a meso-level arena where state actors, corporations, and communities interact, negotiate legitimacy, and contest the distribution of national wealth.

This field-centric lens foregrounds how:

- **Executive corruption** acts as an endogenous field disruption, eroding shared governance norms.
- **Ownership structure** (NOCs vs. IOCs) conditions how corruption is perceived and politicized.

## Conceptual Innovation: What is a Petroprotest?

A **petroprotest** is defined as *unarmed collective action rooted in grievances over the governance, distribution, or symbolic meaning of oil resources*. Unlike generic protests, petroprotests:

- Emerge from violations of shared moral claims about oil as a national good
- Often target NOCs, whose corruption is seen as a betrayal of public trust
- Combine material demands (e.g., jobs, environmental protection) with symbolic ones (e.g., justice, sovereignty)

## Empirical Design: Telescopic Methodology

This study employs a **multi-scalar research design** that zooms from global patterns to individual attitudes:

1. **Cross-National Dataset (2005–2019)**  
   - First systematic dataset of 8,200+ petroprotests  
   - Negative binomial regressions show oil infrastructure predicts protest only where executive corruption is high  
   - Effects are **strongest under NOC ownership**

2. **Subnational Analysis**  
   - Grid-cell models reveal protests cluster near oil sites, especially where corruption is high  
   - The protest effect decays over distance but remains robust under high corruption

3. **Original Survey in Iraq**  
   - Majority of respondents attribute protests to executive corruption  
   - NOCs are perceived as more corrupt than IOCs  
   - These perceptions are strongly associated with protest participation

## Key Findings

- **Executive corruption** transforms governance failure into protest fuel by violating public trust.
- **National Oil Companies (NOCs)** serve as protest focal points, symbolizing broken social contracts.
- **Civil society engagement** moderates contention: transparency and consultation dampen protest, while repression intensifies it.
- **Petroprotests** are highly spatialized and shaped by both material deprivation and symbolic betrayal.
- Protest dynamics are not just resource-driven but field-dependent—shaped by how oil is governed, framed, and experienced.

## Active Research: Iraq Case Study

Currently conducting deep-dive fieldwork in Iraq to examine:

- Local perceptions of oil governance and trust in NOCs vs. IOCs  
- Patterns of protest participation and claim-making  
- Community-company relations in high-extraction zones  
- Perceived fairness of revenue distribution and infrastructure access  
- Environmental and health consequences of oil operations

## Contributions

This research makes the following contributions:

1. **Theoretical**: Defines the *Petro Field* and *petroprotest* as new concepts in resource politics.
2. **Empirical**: Introduces the first cross-national dataset of oil-related protests (2005–2019).
3. **Methodological**: Applies a telescopic design to bridge macro, meso, and micro levels of analysis.
4. **Policy-Relevant**: Offers guidance for mitigating unrest through institutional reform, transparency, and public accountability.
5. **Comparative**: Challenges simplistic oil curse narratives by showing when and how protest arises peacefully within oil fields.
